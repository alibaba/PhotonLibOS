# What is Photon

**Photon** is a highly efficiencient LibOS framework with a set of
carefully crafted modules. Although behaves differently to std::thread,
```photon::thread``` is lightweight and lightning fast --- probably
the fastest coroutine lib in the world.

We believe that nothing is faster than photon, and nothing is more
lightweight than photon.

### Coroutine runtime

Photon's runtime is driven by a coroutine lib. Out tests show that it has the [**best ðŸ”—**](../performance/network-performance#2-ping-pong) IO performance in the open source world by the year of 2022, even among different programing languages.


### Core Features

* Stackful coroutine. Symmetric scheduler. Multi-core parallelism.
* Non-blocking IO engine. Async event engine. Support epoll / kqueue / **io_uring**.
* Support multiple platforms and architectures, x86 / ARM, Linux / macOS.
* Well-designed assembly code on the critical path, to reduce overhead.
* Fully compatible API toward C++ std and POSIX. Easy to migrate to legacy codebases.

### Users

Some open source projects are using Photon as well, for instance:

- [containerd/overlaybd](https://github.com/containerd/overlaybd) The storage backend of accelerated container image, providing a layering block-level image format, designed for container, secure container and virtual machine.
- [data-accelerator/photon-libtcmu](https://github.com/data-accelerator/photon-libtcmu) A TCMU implementation, reworked from tcmu-runner, acting as a iSCSI target.
- The [V language](https://vlang.io/) is trying Photon as an experimental coroutine runtime. [link](https://github.com/vlang/v/blob/master/vlib/coroutines/coroutines.v)
- [aliyun/oss-connector-for-ai-ml](https://github.com/aliyun/oss-connector-for-ai-ml) A high-performance Python library for connecting AI/ML frameworks with OSS storage.

Any addition to this list is appreciated, if you have been using Photon, or just enlightened by its coroutine design.

### Vision

We want to defend the ancient justice of sychronized programming paradigm,
dispite challenged by modern highly concurrent demands.

We want to change the world of high-performance servers, to prevent the
worsening situation of callback hell, and to protect the precious peace
in production environments.

We want to sleep early and sleep well everyday, til the next morning without
interruptions.

And we also want to make friends with common interests, to fight together
for the better future.

### History

Photon was originally created from the storage team of Alibaba Cloud since 2018. It's a production ready library, and has
been deployed to hundreds of thousands of hosts as the infrastructure of cloud software. **We would like to make a
commitment that Photon will be continuously updated, as long as those cloud software still evolve**.
