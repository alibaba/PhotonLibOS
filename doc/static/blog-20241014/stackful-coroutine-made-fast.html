<p>Stackful coroutine, also known as user-space cooperative thread,
offers the promise of more intuitive and accessible concurrent
programming. With the growing demand for highly concurrent programs,
stackful coroutine has gained increasing interest in recent years. It
has, however, been much maligned for poor performance compared to
stackless coroutine because of its heavy reliance on context switching.
In this paper we perform in-depth measurement and analysis of several
advanced implementations of stackful and stackless coroutine. Our
analysis indicates that although current implementations of stackful
coroutines are indeed significantly slower than their stackless
counterparts, stackful coroutine is not intrinsically slow. Rather,
stackful coroutine performs poorly mainly because the current
implementations do not fully leverage the fact that control flow is
cooperatively passed among stackful coroutines. Based on this
observation, we propose context-aware context switching (CACS) among
stackful coroutines. Instead of a full set of registers, CACS saves
(restores) only the minimum necessary set of registers according to the
caller (callee) context. It also enables the branch to be inlined at the
caller site so that branch prediction is more accurate. We have
implemented CACS in Photon, a highly optimized libOS based on coroutine.
Performance measurements show that with the optimizations proposed in
this paper, stackful coroutine out-performs stackless coroutine in most
cases, and ties in the generator paradigm which is an especially
challenging scenario for stackful coroutine. We also suggest a few
supporting changes in computer architecture, programming language,
compiler and OS that can further improve the performance of stackful
coroutine. Our work is open-sourced on GitHub<a href="#fn1"

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Modern servers may have network connectivity with bandwidth that is
on the same order as that of its memory or CPU interconnect <span
class="citation" data-cites="eflops">[<a href="#ref-eflops"
role="doc-biblioref">27</a>]</span>, and host dozens of SSDs each
offering more than 10GB/s of throughput <span class="citation"
data-cites="memblaze7940">[<a href="#ref-memblaze7940"
role="doc-biblioref">34</a>]</span>. With such advances in the hardware
I/O capability, software stacks must become both highly concurrent and
efficient to unleash the growing performance potential of the modern
server. Recent software improvements to this effect include the
development of high-performance I/O frameworks, such as DPDK <span
class="citation" data-cites="dpdk">[<a href="#ref-dpdk"
role="doc-biblioref">5</a>]</span> and SPDK <span class="citation"
data-cites="spdk">[<a href="#ref-spdk"
role="doc-biblioref">10</a>]</span>, that budget to process a single
packet or request in terms of CPU cycles.</p>
<p>Coroutine has also been gaining increasing attention in recent years
to handle concurrent programming efficiently and effectively.
Programming languages that have or are embracing coroutine include
C++20 <span class="citation" data-cites="cpp20std">[<a
href="#ref-cpp20std" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span>, Rust 1.39 <span
class="citation" data-cites="rust139">[<a href="#ref-rust139"
role="doc-biblioref">2</a>]</span> in 2019, C# 5.0 <span
class="citation" data-cites="csharp">[<a href="#ref-csharp"
role="doc-biblioref">15</a>]</span> in 2012, Python 3.5 <span
class="citation" data-cites="py35">[<a href="#ref-py35"
role="doc-biblioref">19</a>]</span> in 2015, JavaScript ES2017 <span
class="citation" data-cites="js17">[<a href="#ref-js17"
role="doc-biblioref">8</a>]</span>, Swift 5.5 <span class="citation"
data-cites="swift55">[<a href="#ref-swift55"
role="doc-biblioref">11</a>]</span> in 2021, Java 21 <span
class="citation" data-cites="java">[<a href="#ref-java"
role="doc-biblioref">7</a>]</span> in 2023, Dragonwell 8 <span
class="citation" data-cites="dragonwell">[<a href="#ref-dragonwell"
role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span> in 2019, etc. Golang <span
class="citation" data-cites="golang">[<a href="#ref-golang"
role="doc-biblioref">14</a>]</span> has provided coroutine (goroutine)
as a first-class construct since its initial design.</p>
<p>There are two types of coroutine — stackless and stackful. The former
shares a default stack among all the coroutines while the latter assigns
a separate stack to each coroutine. With stackless coroutine, the code
is transformed into event handlers at compile time, and driven by an
event engine at run time, i.e. the scheduler of stackless coroutine.
Transferring control of CPU to a stackless coroutine is merely a
function call with an argument pointing to its context. Conversely,
transferring CPU control to a stackful coroutine requires a context
switch. This context switch is widely regarded as a heavy-weight
operation when compared to the function call. In reality, this context
switch is much more efficient than a kernel task switch because it does
not incur the overhead of a round-trip transition from user-space to
kernel-space, and it is also possible to perform optimizations by making
use of the cooperative nature of the coroutines within a single
program.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, due primarily to the perceived performance concern
(among other issues), more and more systems are abandoning stackful
coroutine for stackless coroutine, especially systems that emphasize
performance such as C++20, Rust, C#, Swift, etc. There was once a heated
debate <span class="citation"
data-cites="fibers-no-scheduler fibers-glass re-fibers-glass re-re-fibers-glass">[<a
href="#ref-fibers-no-scheduler" role="doc-biblioref">29</a>, <a
href="#ref-re-fibers-glass" role="doc-biblioref">37</a>–<a
href="#ref-re-re-fibers-glass" role="doc-biblioref">39</a>]</span> in
the C++ standards committee over stackless or stackful coroutine for
C++20. Although stackful coroutine is generally easier to use, more
compatible with existing codebases and more efficient in many scenarios,
the proponents of stackless coroutine constructed a microbenchmark <span
class="citation" data-cites="wanbox">[<a href="#ref-wanbox"
role="doc-biblioref">17</a>]</span> to show that “fibers (stackful
coroutines) have 20 times larger context switch overhead” than stackless
coroutine <span class="citation" data-cites="fibers-glass">[<a
href="#ref-fibers-glass" role="doc-biblioref">38</a>]</span>. The
defendants of stackful coroutine did not give a direct response to the
challenge <span class="citation" data-cites="re-fibers-glass">[<a
href="#ref-re-fibers-glass" role="doc-biblioref">37</a>]</span>, and
ultimately the committee adopted stackless coroutine for C++20. We
believe that the demonstrated outsized difference in overhead played an
important role in this decision, as well as similar decisions for other
systems.</p>
<p>In this paper we argue that stackful coroutine is not intrinsically
slow. It just has not been implemented to fully exploit the cooperative
nature of stackful coroutine, and there are opportunities to make
context switching more efficient. We perform in-depth measurement and
analysis of several current coroutine implementations. Based on the
analysis, we propose context-aware context switching (CACS) to improve
the efficiency of register saving, accuracy of branch prediction, and
hit rate of CPU cache. CACS leverages the fact that context switches
among stackful coroutines occur only at specific caller sites. With
CACS, each context switching saves only the registers that will be
needed after it switches back, and these registers are determined by the
compiler at the caller site. CACS also enables the branching to be
inlined at the caller site so that branch prediction is more accurate.
We apply CACS to optimize stackful asymmetric coroutine by designing
in-stack generator. With CACS, it performs as efficiently as the
corresponding stackless coroutine implementation. We also introduce a
new function calling convention named <code>preserve_none</code> as an
expansion of CACS for all switching functions to further improve
performance. With our work the cost of yield operation (scheduling and
switching to the next coroutine) is greatly reduced. CACS is implemented
in Photon <span class="citation" data-cites="photon">[<a
href="#ref-photon" role="doc-biblioref">9</a>]</span>, a sophisticated
libOS based on coroutine. The proposed calling convention is implemented
in Clang <span class="citation" data-cites="clang">[<a href="#ref-clang"
role="doc-biblioref">4</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we demonstrate that stackless coroutine is
inefficient in handling multi-level invocation, an inevitable pattern in
real-world programs. It even incurs an overhead proportional to the
length of the call chain when dealing with recursion. Despite there are
optimizations that can reduce this overhead to a constant in some
scenarios, it is still much higher than the corresponding overhead with
stackful coroutine. Our results suggest that stackful coroutine is the
better choice for efficient concurrency.</p>
<p>The contributions of this paper are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>We conduct an in-depth performance characterization of
state-of-the-art implementations of both stackless and stackful
coroutines, analyzing the root causes for various measured
differences.</p></li>
<li><p>We observe that there are untapped opportunities to improve the
performance of stackful coroutine by exploiting the fact that coroutines
are cooperatively scheduled user-space threads.</p></li>
<li><p>We propose and implement CACS to optimize the performance of
stackful coroutine, and demonstrate that it can effectively eliminate
the performance concern of context switching, thereby raising the
performance upper bound of stackful coroutine. CACS makes stackful
coroutine even feasible for challenging scenarios such as the generator
paradigm. The overall result is promising: a single Xeon CPU core can
perform a yield operation in ~1.52 ns or ~3.34 cycles, comparable to the
cost of a function call, and out-performing state-of-the-art result by
several times.</p></li>
<li><p>While we demonstrate promising results with CACS, the current
implementation is still constrained by existing architecture,
programming language, compiler and OS. We suggest several supporting
changes in these areas that can further improve the performance of
stackful coroutine.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="sec:measurement">Performance Measurement of Coroutines</h1>
<p>In this section, we carry out in-depth measurement of coroutine
implementations, trying to find out how such a big difference as “20
times” <span class="citation" data-cites="fibers-glass">[<a
href="#ref-fibers-glass" role="doc-biblioref">38</a>]</span> in speed
was formed, and whether there are opportunities for optimizations. We
begin with the micro benchmark of sequence’s sum that was used in the
test, then expand its structure in two ways respectively: callee
recursion (Hanoi) and caller nesting (write_fully) with concurrent
execution. These expansions represents some common scenarios in real
applications.</p>
<p>Besides the classification of stackful or stackless coroutine, they
can also be classified as symmetric or asymmetric coroutine <span
class="citation" data-cites="moura2009revisiting">[<a
href="#ref-moura2009revisiting" role="doc-biblioref">36</a>]</span>. The
former provides a single control-transfer operation that allows
coroutines to explicitly pass control between themselves. The latter
provides two control-transfer operations: one for invoking a coroutine
and one for suspending it, possibly carrying return value(s) to the
caller. Asymmetric coroutine can be resumed repeatedly to generate a
series of return values. That’s why it is also called generator.</p>
<h2 id="coroutines-under-the-microscope">Coroutines under the
Microscope</h2>
<p>We revisit the performance benchmark <span class="citation"
data-cites="wanbox">[<a href="#ref-wanbox"
role="doc-biblioref">17</a>]</span> that was used in C++ committee, and
we are able to reproduce similar results in our environment, with latest
compiler (Clang 15.0.3), latest dependent library (Boost 1.81), and
trivial changes to the source code (e.g., removing the “experimental”
namespace). The benchmark includes two cases, respectively for stackful
coroutine implemented by Boost.Coroutine2 and stackless coroutine
built-in C++20. Both of them consist of a generator that produces
natural number from <span class="math inline"><em>N</em></span> down to
<span class="math inline">1</span>, and a reducer that sums the numbers
up.</p>
<p>We have managed to reduce the overhead of stackful coroutine down to
~4 times with some simple efforts such as: disabling assertion, raising
up optimization level from -O2 to -O3, forced inlining all possible
functions involved in the kernel loops, and re-implementing a third test
case using Boost.Context directly. The overall result is depicted in
Fig <a href="#fig:ss-brkdn" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:ss-brkdn">1</a>.</p>

Breakdown of the ~20 times overhead of Boost stackful coroutine compared
to C++20 stackless coroutine in the micro benchmark of sequence’s
sum.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To find possible opportunities for further improvements, we analyze
the implementation by disassembling its machine code. We find that a
function jump_fcontext() contributes to most of the remaining overhead.
It is a handcrafted assembly function consisting 24 instructions to
perform context switching. It saves and restores a set of registers
including <code>r12</code>~<code>r15</code>, <code>rbx</code>,
<code>rbp</code>, x87 FPU control word (FCW), MMX/SSE control status
register (MXCSR) and finally <code>rsp</code>, the stack pointer
register. The list is determined by the function calling convention in
use, and classic context switching functions save and restore all these
registers in order to conform to the convention. But most of these
registers are not used at all in such simple case as this, and it is a
great waste to do it blindly. We believe it is better for the compiler
to smartly determine what actually needs to be done before and after
each context switching operation at the calling site, and do it all by
itself. We have realized this optimization with some inline assembly
code and a simple optional compiler extension. As a result, the cost of
a context switching becomes similar to that of an ordinary function
call. We’ll describe this work in section <a href="#sec:optimal"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:optimal">3</a>.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that, when we change the stackless
producer()’s implementation from <code>for</code> loop to simpler and
identical <code>while</code> loop, as shown in Fig. <a
href="#fig:gen_for_while" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:gen_for_while">2</a>, its time cost increases
unexpectedly by ~50% (see section <a href="#sec:eval"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:eval">4</a> for details).
We suspect it’s due to the limitation of current compiler optimization
for stackless coroutine, as it involves somewhat complex translation of
the code.</p>

<h2 id="coroutines-in-the-telescope">Coroutines in the Telescope</h2>
<p>Stackless coroutine can be inefficient when it yields some value to
the original caller from a deep call chain of recursion, because the
operation is designed to be targeting at the direct caller, and it may
incur a high overhead of <span
class="math inline"><em>O</em>(<em>n</em>)</span> to cross multiple
levels. This scenario is depicted in Fig <a
href="#fig:nested-call-yeild" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:nested-call-yeild">3</a>.</p>
<p>Many important recursive algorithms fits this pattern, such as
traversing a tree and yielding every node to the caller, or performing a
depth-first-search in a graph (or other state spaces) and yielding each
item found. Most coroutine implementations are subject to this problem,
such as C#, Python, etc. Python provides “<code>yield from</code>” for
this scenario to forward values from multi-level invocations, but only
as a syntax sugar without any improvement to its performance. Rust has
experimental support for generator, and it does not yet support
multi-level invocations of generators. C++23 introduced an optimized
implementation as <code>std::generator</code>, which achieves <span
class="math inline"><em>O</em>(1)</span> delivery for multi-level
invocations in stackless coroutines, by sophisticated manipulation of
coroutine handles. But it still incurs a great overhead compared to
generators based on stackful coroutine.</p>

</figure>
<p>We study this problem by solving the classic puzzle Tower of Hanoi in
both stackful and stackless coroutine. As depicted in Fig. <a
href="#fig:hanoi" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:hanoi">4</a>, it is a simple recursive algorithm
consisting only 4 lines of effective code. It is good a representative
for recursion in real applications. We reimplement it respectively with
C++20 stackless coroutine, C++23 stackless generator, and Boost stackful
coroutine.</p>
<p>The results are shown in Fig <a href="#fig:hanoi-perf"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:hanoi-perf">5</a>, as
relative time cost of coroutines compared to classic function recursion,
so as to eliminate the exponential growth of the algorithm, and clearly
reflect the overhead of coroutine yield and resume. The <span
class="math inline"><em>O</em>(1)</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>O</em>(<em>n</em>)</span> overhead growths are
clearly shown in the results, and the overhead of C++20 coroutine can
even reach 50 times when the number of disks is 20. C++23 generator has
<span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(1)</span> asymptotic growth,
though, its overhead is still much higher than that of stackful
coroutine with Boost. The results suggest that stackless coroutine is
not efficient for recursion. And we’ll also show in section <a
href="#Macroscope" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="Macroscope">2.3</a> that it is not efficient either for
non-recursive multi-level invocation, which is a common practice in
non-trivial applications.</p>
<p>To further study C++23 std::generator (Gen23) and Boost, we use the
<code>perf</code> tool to respectively monitor them solving Hanoi(1~20).
We see that Gen23 has executed ~15 billions of instructions in ~5.8
billions of cycles (2.58 per cycle). And Boost has executed ~2.05
billions of instructions in 938 millions of cycles (2.19 per cycle). The
former executes much more instructions at a higher IPC (Instructions Per
Cycle) speed than the latter, indicating a more complex solution. We
also notice that Boost has a 5.36% miss rate for branch prediction,
which is much higher than that of Gen23 (0.76%). We believe it’s due to
the context switching function, jump_fcontext(), which jumps to a
location different from that of the previous run, thus hard to predict.
We’ll solve this problem with context-aware context switching. See
details in section <a href="#sec:cacs" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:cacs">3.1</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Macroscope">Coroutines in the “Macroscope”</h2>
<p>We measure how coroutines perform in a scenario of multiple
conceptual threads of execution running concurrently. We simulate a
server-type workload with both coroutine models, by creating 10
concurrent tasks, with each sending 100 MB of data through a network
connection to its client. We mimic the non-blocking socket API that can
send some number (&gt;0) of bytes in each invocation if it is ready for
write (there’s some room in its internal buffer), and we have to repeat
it in a loop until all data has been sent. In order that the measurement
is repeatable and not too fast, we assume that every invocation to
send_some() can send exactly 800 bytes, and is preceded by an invocation
to <code>wait_for_ready()</code> that only switches execution to other
tasks. This is effectively the pattern of non-recursive multi-level
invocation. As the actual networking and event engine (e.g. epoll) are
not the target of this test, they are not included in order that we
focus on the coroutine part of the program.</p>
<p>Two implementations are involved in this measurement, C++20 stackless
coroutine and Boost.Context stackful coroutine. We employ simple
round-robin scheduling for both of them.</p>
<figure id="fig:write-fully">
<embed src="figures/write-fully.pdf.png" style="width:98.0%" />
<figcaption><span id="fig:write-fully"
data-label="fig:write-fully"></span> Execution time for simulation of
concurrent write_fully(). Rust (based on tokio) and C# (compiled to
native code) are included as references only.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Fig. <a href="#fig:write-fully" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:write-fully">6</a> shows the results of our
measurement, including those from Rust and C# as references only. Boost
achieves the best performance with stackful coroutine. We further study
the cases in C++ with <code>perf</code> tool, in order to investigate
any other reasons for such differences besides multi-level invocation.
We find that C++20 coroutine incurs major overhead in memory
allocation/deallocation for coroutine context. This indicates that
memory pooling is very important for stackless coroutine, the ideal
pooling might be a linear data structure for each conceptual thread of
execution, and it grows with <code>co_await</code> and shrinks with
<code>co_return</code>, as suggested in <span class="citation"
data-cites="re-fibers-glass">[<a href="#ref-re-fibers-glass"
role="doc-biblioref">37</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>We also find that the scheduler for C++20 coroutine incurs an
overhead higher than that for Boost, despite we try to make both of them
as simple and identical as possible. The question is answered with some
extra counters: C++20 coroutine invokes scheduler several times more
than Boost coroutine. It turns out that every <code>co_await</code> in
the program makes the control return to the scheduler then calls the
target coroutine from there. <code>co_return</code> and
<code>co_yield</code> follow the reversed control flow. It is possible
for stackless coroutine to apply an optimistic optimization: invoke the
target first without returning to the scheduler, speculating that the
target will complete without actually <code>co_yield</code>-ing or
<code>co_await</code>-ing. This optimization can be applied repeatedly
until it eventually has to go back to the scheduler, by successive
returning. This pattern is useful for submitting asynchronous I/O
operations that may complete immediately in some cases (e.g. there’s
enough internal buffer for write), so there is no need to wait for its
completion in this case. We don’t employ this optimization because we
are focusing on the coroutine part of the program in the measurement,
whereas this optimization avoids the part in the case of successful
speculation.</p>
<p>We also notice with <code>perf</code> that the Boost-based case
incurs a miss rate of 13.08% for L1 data cache load, which is much
higher than the case with C++20 coroutine (0.01%). In such a micro
benchmark, all data loads in the kernel loop should be cache-hit. We
believe it’s due to not-too-coincidental collisions in the set-associate
algorithm of cache, and it should be caused almost deterministically by
the default alignment of allocation for stack, combined with the
homogenization of the running coroutines. And we believe that’s why the
application part of stackful case is slower than that of stackless case.
The issue probably influences context switching too, because the context
is also saved on stack. And the issue probably occurs in many other
benchmarks and applications based on stackful coroutine or user-space
threads, because this pair of conditions are easy to meet in real
applications, especially on servers. We resolve this issue by simply
introducing a random factor to the starting address of stack, making the
stackful case significantly faster. See section <a href="#sec:eval"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:eval">4</a> for further
results.</p>
<h1 id="sec:optimal">Context-Aware Context Switching (CACS)</h1>
<p>In this section, we present our proposals to make stackful coroutine
fast. We first propose a novel approach to perform context-aware context
switching (CACS), which saves and restores a least necessary number of
registers decided by the compiler at the calling site. It makes use of
inline assembly, and spreads out the indirect jump of CACS, possibly
improving the rate of correct branch prediction. We then apply CACS to
asymmetric coroutines by proposing in-stack generator, a new design that
realize efficient yield() and resume(), as well as stack reuse in the
case of non-concurrent generators. Thirdly we propose a new calling
convention, preserve_none, for functions that are expected to switch
context, so as to further improve performance. This is actually an
expansion of CACS for caller functions to make sure the gains are not
masked by them.</p>
<h2 id="sec:cacs">Design</h2>
<p>As discussed in previous section, the classic context switching
function saves and restores a fixed list of registers before making an
indirect jump to the target location. The function is usually
implemented in separate assembly code that is completely unaware of the
functions that invoke context switching. All that it can do is saving
and restoring every callee-saved register as specified in the function
calling convention in use, treating every switching like a worst case
function call.</p>
<p>To address the problem and make every cycle count, we propose a novel
design of context-aware context switching (CACS), which saves and
restores a least necessary number of registers decided by the compiler
at the caller site. The compiler will generate instructions to save all
necessary registers to stack before executing context switching, and
restore them after switching. The compiler will also do a trade-off
between saving / restoring a register and recomputing it.</p>

<figcaption><span id="fig:CACS" data-label="fig:CACS"></span> The code
template for Context-Aware Context Switching (CACS) using inline
assembly. The key point is informing the compiler that <em>all</em>
registers will be clobbered by this code template, so the compiler
itself will generate instructions before and after this code template to
exactly save and restore necessary registers at this site.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We design CACS as a code template using standard inline assembly, as
shown in Fig. <a href="#fig:CACS" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:CACS">7</a>. The instructions should be adapted to
coroutine type and control structure definition. The key point is the
bottom lines that define a list of all registers clobbered by the
assembly code, so that the compiler will save and restore the registers
that are needed after the code template. CACS is inlined at the caller
site, making branch predictions for the jump easier to be correct. This
is more useful for asymmetric coroutine (generator) where users directly
make context switching without resorting to a scheduler. In contrast,
classic context switching is typically implemented as a stand-alone
assembly function, which is written and compiled without any knowledge
of the particular contexts that make the invocation. If CACS is invoked
at the end of a function, we can apply tail call optimization by using
the function’s return address as switch-back address, avoiding an extra
indirect jumping.</p>
<h2 id="sec:in-stack-gen">In-Stack Generator with CACS</h2>
<p>In the previous section stackful coroutine implemented with Boost
remained ~4 times overhead compared to stackless coroutine in the
microbenchmark of sum of sequence. According to our analysis, stackless
coroutine transforms the code into event-driven form at compile time,
and each invocation to the generator corresponds still to a function
call. Whereas stackful coroutine creates a new stack for the generator,
and each invocation corresponds to a context switching. We monitor the
execution of both test cases with <code>perf</code> tool, and find that
they show similar instruction per cycle (IPC): 2.29 for stackful and
2.49 for stackless. So their difference in performance must come
primarily from the number of instructions executed in their kernel
loops. By disassembling we find that, the context switching function,
jump_fcontext(), consists 24 instructions, which gets executed twice in
each iteration. While a pair of function call and return in this case
costs only few instructions.</p>
<p>To resolve the problem, we (1) use CACS to greatly reduce the number
of instructions for saving and restoring registers; we (2) reuse the
current stack to further simplify switching (in addition to eliminating
the allocation of a new stack); and (3) we exploit the fact that there
exists a conceptual relationship of caller-callee, by defining a simple
&amp; efficient convention to ease the cooperation. We realize
switchings with only 3 instructions, for both back and forth. The cost
is similar to that of a function call / return, making stackful
coroutine as performant as stackless coroutine.</p>

Implementations with in-stack generator</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We define new primitives to allow a function (generator) to switch
the execution (yield) to the caller without terminating its execution,
resulting a stack layout as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig:in-stack-gen"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:in-stack-gen">8</a>. The
yield operation carries an application-defined value in register
<code>rax</code> to the caller, as a form of “return value”. The
operation also carries additional information (frame pointer in
<code>rsi</code> and instruction pointer in <code>rdx</code>), so that
the caller can later resume the generator’s execution. The resume
operation is also a context switching, carrying additional information
(frame pointer in <code>rsi</code> and instruction pointer in
<code>rdi</code>) for the generator to yield back.</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. <a href="#fig:gen" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:gen">9</a>, an in-stack generator (<code>seq</code>
or <code>hanoi</code>) is implemented like a normal function, with the
first argument being GCTX*, which actually points to the caller’s stack
frame. And the function must create a GPromise object on entry, so as
for the generator to yield results back to the caller. The first yield
jumps to the caller right after the invocation, making it seem as if it
comes back from a normal return. The promise object gets destructed
automatically on exit of the generator, and on this occasion it
overrides the generator function’s return address with an actual
position where the caller has executed to. It also sets the resume
address as NULL, indicating termination of the generator.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig:gen-asm-cmp" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:gen-asm-cmp">10</a> shows a direct comparison of
compiled kernel loops of the proposed stackful generator with CACS and
those of C++20 stackless generator, using the sequence’s sum test case.
As a result the two implementations have exactly the same number of
instructions, and they show similar performance numbers (see section <a
href="#sec:eval" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:eval">4</a> for details).</p>
<h2 id="sec:ccpn">Calling Convention for Switching Functions</h2>
<p>The default calling convention (CC) is sub-optimal for functions that
are expected to switch context, either directly or indirectly. The
default CC is designed for general cases, in which some registers are
expected not to be modified by the callee function. This condition is
not met if the execution of callee clobbers all registers, and context
switching is one of such cases.</p>
<p>The optimal strategy to call a switching function is to expect all
registers will be clobbered, and define all registers as caller-saved,
so as to avoid unnecessary saving and restoring. We have designed such a
new CC named as preserve_none, meaning that the function will preserve
none of the registers, and the callers must spill all necessary
registers themselves. Applying this new CC to a switching function is
either beneficial (if the caller is simple) or not worse (if the caller
is complex), because the number of spilled registers in the new CC can
not be greater than the total number of caller-saved registers and
callee-saved registers in the default CC. Note that non-switching
functions, such as <code>malloc</code>, should use the default CC as
before.</p>
<p>The new CC acts as an expansion of CACS for the caller functions to
unleash the full potential. It is important for simple switching
functions. Take the yield() function in symmetric coroutine for example,
which does simple scheduling (e.g. round-robin) then switch the context.
It doesn’t save / restore any registers by itself, but adopting CACS
will make it so for all necessary registers to comply to the default CC.
As a result, there would be hardly performance gain, because the cost is
only teleported from context_switch() to yield().</p>

<figcaption><span id="fig:yield-preserve-none"
data-label="fig:yield-preserve-none"></span> The yield() function with
<code>preserve_none</code> calling convention (left) is compiled to 12
instructions (right) .</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As shown in Fig. <a href="#fig:yield-preserve-none"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:yield-preserve-none">11</a>, a possible yield()
function with preserve_none CC could be compiled to only 12 machine
instructions, containing no register saving at all. The callers will
save and restore registers according to their real needs. The
implementation also makes use of the fact that the switching is the tail
of the function, by combining “jumping to target context” and “returning
to the caller” as a single step — jmpq *%rax, without resorting to the
final retq<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. If yield() uses the default CC, its
compiled code will have 12 more instructions for spilling 6 registers as
required, and the tail-call optimization will become infeasible
either.</p>
<p>Applying the new CC is simply to add a new attribute to the target
function, and the syntax can be further simplified by using the macro
CO, as shown in Fig <a href="#fig:yield-preserve-none"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:yield-preserve-none">11</a>. The burden of applying
the new CC is much less than that of applying stackless coroutine, which
forces to change the return types of all involving functions, as well as
the syntax of every invocation. Whereas the proposed CC is only an
option to further improve performance.</p>
<p>The new CC is also applicable to in-stack generators, because they
switch context too, and the switching functions, yield() and resume() in
our work, clobber all registers as well. This behavior makes preserving
registers useless for them.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>We have implemented CACS for Clang/GCC compilers, x86-64
architecture, SysV (AMD64) ABI. The implementation is a library of 2
header files, respectively for symmetric and asymmetric coroutine
(generator). The former is ~40 lines, including tail-call optimization;
and the latter one is ~90 lines, including support for both sides of the
generators. CACS doesn’t require modifications to compiler tool chain.
The implementation is based on Photon <span class="citation"
data-cites="photon">[<a href="#ref-photon"
role="doc-biblioref">9</a>]</span>, assuming control struct of symmetric
coroutine defined in it. Specifically, we store switch-back address at
top of stack, and stack pointer (SP) in the control struct by an offset
of 0x10.</p>
<p>We have implemented in-stack generator in the library too, using the
core concept of CACS. The differences here are: (1) we switch stack
frames instead of the whole stack; (2) a value is passed in a register
along with each switching from the generator to its caller; (3) as the
switching target is fixed and known at compile time for both sides, so
we can pass the switch-back address to the opposite side via a register,
in order to exploit a chance to avoid storing it to memory. The
implementation is a header file of ~90 lines.</p>
<p>We have implemented the new CC <code>preserve_none</code> in Clang
and its backend LLVM, primarily in 3 steps. Firstly we define the new CC
in LLVM’s header file CallingConv.h by adding a new enum member
PreserveNone. And we define the list for its callee-saved registers in
the TableGen file X86CallingConv.td, by inheriting the class
CalleeSavedRegs and setting the list as CSR_NoRegs, a predefined
constant in LLVM representing an empty list. Then we implement the new
CC’s behaviors in LLVM. Such as, extending the function
getCalleeSavedRegs() in class X86RegisterInfo so that it recognizes the
new CC as argument, and returns an empty list of registers for callee to
save. We also update the instruction selector’s function
canGuaranteeTCO() in X86ISelLowering.cpp so that tail-call optimization
can be applied to invocations with the new CC. Finally we extend the
frontend clang to accept the new CC as an attribute of function. So that
if a function is tagged as “__attribute__((preserve_none))”, all
invocations to that function will be using the proposed CC.</p>
<p>We have also implemented some helper tools in Clang/LLVM compiler
tool chain to assist applying the proposed CC to large applications
without modifying the source code. First, we add an option for Clang to
accept a list of functions from a file. All functions that occur in the
list during compilation will be implicitly applied with the proposed CC.
Second, we add another option for the compiler to automatically applying
the preserve_none CC (APN) to proper functions. When a function
<code>foo</code> with default CC calls another function with
preserve_none CC, we infect <code>foo</code> as preserve_none if (1) its
address is never taken, not even by a virtual function table; (2) its
symbol is not exported in the final outcome (the main function is
considered exported). If these functions do need preserve_none, we must
mark it explicitly in the source code. APN is realized as an extra pass
in LLVM, just before instruction selector (PreISel). We first create a
work list including all functions that are explicitly marked as
preserve_none. Then for each function in the list, we enumerate its
callers to determine whether it is possible to infect the caller as
preserve_none, and if so, we add it to the work list as well after
infection. The process repeats until the work list becomes empty.</p>
<h1 id="sec:eval">Evaluation</h1>
<p>In this section we evaluate stackful coroutine equipped with all the
proposed optimizations, denoted as CACS in a unification. Because
in-stack generator is the application of CACS in asymmetric coroutine,
and the preserve_none CC is an expansion of CACS for the caller
functions to unleash the full potential of CACS. The CC seems to be
useful only with CACS together. We also include stack address
randomization in the evaluation, although it is an independent technique
and applicable to other systems. We compare the results with Boost and
C++20 stackless coroutines. Our testbed is a physical server with dual
Intel Xeon CPU @ 2.2GHz and 128GB of memory.</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="sum-of-sequence">Sum of Sequence</h2>
<p>We evaluate CACS (in-stack generator) using sum-of-sequence
benchmark, and compare it with other implementations. We also include a
derived edition of the test case in C++20, by replacing the for-loop in
producer() with a seemingly equivalent while-loop.</p>
<p>Fig. <a href="#fig:sum-of-seq" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:sum-of-seq">12</a> shows the results. It is as
speculated in previous section that CACS performs similarly well with
C++20 coroutine. It is unexpected that the two editions in C++20 perform
differently. This suggests that compiler optimization has a room for
improvement, and this may also suggest that measurement at
nano-second-scale is difficult, as slight changes may lead to noticeable
difference.</p>
<p>We anticipate that CACS and in-stack generator would perform better
in non-trivial applications, because its target code has less branches
and memory accesses than those in stackless coroutine (4+4 vs 5+7, as
shown in Fig. <a href="#fig:gen-asm-cmp" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:gen-asm-cmp">10</a>). These instructions tend to
have higher miss rate in reality, due to resource contentions in TLB,
branch predictor, multiple levels of caches, etc.</p>
<h2 id="hanoi">Hanoi</h2>
<p>We evaluate CACS (in-stack generator) using the puzzle of Hanoi, and
compare it with other implementations. Fig. <a href="#fig:hanoi-proton"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:hanoi-proton">13</a> shows
the results of relative time costs of coroutines normalized to that of
function recursion + callback. CACS is roughly twice as fast as Boost,
and they are both much faster than stackless coroutines. C# performs
close to C++ in function recursion, so we are able to include its result
as a reference. (Rust currently doesn’t support yielding from recursive
generator.)</p>

</figure>
<p>And we also see with <code>perf</code> tool that CACS reduces the
number of branch-misses from ~11.8M in Boost to ~1.62M in CACS,
exhibiting a significant improvement, though it is still lightly worse
than function recursion and callback. The reason is that the switching
of context clobbers all registers on both sides, whereas the the
callback can preserve some registers on the caller’s side. We believe
there is room for further improvement on this issue, and the optimal
performance should be very close to that of function recursion.</p>
<h2 id="write_fully">write_fully()</h2>
<p>We evaluate CACS using write_fully() in symmetric coroutines, and
compare it with other implementations. Fig. <a
href="#fig:write-fully-proton" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:write-fully-proton">14</a> shows the results. CACS
is much faster than Boost and C++20 stackless coroutine. And the
breakdown shows that CACS is fast in both scheduling (together with
context switching) and application, we believe it is due to stack entry
randomization that avoids coincidental cache collisions between the
concurrent coroutines. And we confirm this speculation with
<code>perf</code> tool. It shows that the miss rate of L1 data cache
drops from 15.83% of Boost to ~0.00% of CACS.</p>
<h2 id="yield">yield()</h2>
<p>We evaluate CACS with yield() operation, by making 10 coroutines
yielding to one another in a loop. We repeat the loop many times and
calculate the average time cost of a single yield. We then subtract the
cost of an empty loop from the result, because it can not be ignored in
the measurement at nano-second-scale. We have managed to avoid any
compiler optimizations applying to the empty loop, and we also emulate
the effect of losing all registers after calling to a preserve_none
function, with a piece of volatile inline assembly code.</p>
<p>In order to break down the optimizations, we first evaluate vanilla
Photon without these optimizations. Then we apply them one by one,
including a special case of small stack. We coincidentally find that
stack size can influence performance, and a small one that is not
aligned<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> to special numbers can often result
in better performance. In this benchmark we use 4,112 bytes for the case
of small stack.</p>
<p>Fig. <a href="#fig:yield+cacs" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:yield+cacs">15</a> shows the results. The time cost
of a single yield is reduced dramatically from 8.97ns to 1.52ns.</p>
<h2 id="http-and-rpc-clients">HTTP and RPC Clients</h2>
<p>We evaluate CACS with HTTP and RPC client respectively, which can
represent close-to-reality workloads. We use those components also from
Photon <span class="citation" data-cites="photon">[<a href="#ref-photon"
role="doc-biblioref">9</a>]</span>, because they allow us to easily mock
their networking layers so as for the results are not affected and
bounded by the physical network hardware. We have managed to avoid most
of the data-copy (except the header of HTTP response), effectively
assuming modern offloaded zero-copy network transport. We run the
benchmarks with a single CPU core, as parallelism is orthogonal to our
proposals. The RPC framework avoids excessive string parsing operations,
making every cycle count for the payload. It is especially useful for
high-performance I/O systems. The test cases are both sending requests
to obtain 1MB of data in each response. The RPC messages are real ones
used in our distributed storage system, deployed at scale in our
production environments. As shown in Fig. <a href="#fig:http-rpc-client"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:http-rpc-client">16</a>,
CACS clearly improves real-world HTTP and RPC clients.</p>

<h1 id="related-work">Related Work</h1>
<p>Coroutine is a form of generalized subroutine that dates back to
decades ago. There are two types of coroutine: stackful and stackless.
The former is also known as user-space thread. It assigns a separate
stack to every coroutine. Whereas the latter makes the default stack
shared by all coroutines. It realizes so usually by transforming the
code into event-driven form at compile time. Both coroutine types depend
on underlaying asynchronous interface to achieve the illusion of
synchronous I/O (storage, network, etc.). There has been a long-standing
debate over which model is better for concurrent programming, events or
threads. The revival of coroutine in recent years may give us a
different view on this problem.</p>
<h2 id="stackful-coroutine-and-user-space-threading">Stackful Coroutine
and User-Space Threading</h2>
<p>One of the most influential stackful coroutine implementation is
perhaps the cooperatively scheduled threads and processes in Windows
3.x, which dominated PC market along with the success of Windows. This
form of threading was easier to implement and more efficient to run in
resource-constrained devices, like PCs at that time. However, the model
requires each thread / process (coroutine) to cooperate with others by
voluntarily yielding its control of CPU to others at appropriate
occasions. Otherwise a buggy (non-cooperative) application can block the
entire system from responding. So this cooperative threading got
deprecated since Windows 95 in preference of preemptive threading. As a
matter of fact, the non-cooperation problem is tolerable within a single
process, and concurrent programming nowadays is becoming increasingly
important, thus we have the revival of stackful coroutine (stackless
too), with Go <span class="citation" data-cites="golang">[<a
href="#ref-golang" role="doc-biblioref">14</a>]</span> being a
representative.</p>
<p>Go provides coroutine (goroutine) as a first-class construct since
its first language design. Goroutine is Go’s answer to concurrent
programming. It supported only one CPU core (no parallelism) at first,
and multiple cores later. It was cooperatively scheduled at first, and
strengthened recently with preemption <span class="citation"
data-cites="go1.14">[<a href="#ref-go1.14"
role="doc-biblioref">6</a>]</span>. C/C++ alway have numerous libraries
of coroutine. Such as state-thread, originally developed by Netscape as
part of NSPR library, and later maintained by SGI, Yahoo.
Boost.Coroutine 1, 2 and Boost.Context <span class="citation"
data-cites="boost">[<a href="#ref-boost"
role="doc-biblioref">12</a>]</span> are a set of authoritative coroutine
libraries for modern C++. There are many other languages also have (some
sort of) support for stackful coroutine, such as Java (since v19) <span

data-cites="php">[<a href="#ref-php"
role="doc-biblioref">18</a>]</span>, etc.</p>
<p>While most coroutines are cooperatively scheduled, which requires a
task explicitly yields its control of CPU so that one of the others can
get executed. There are work to add preemption to coroutines. Most
proposals <span class="citation"

based on timer signal, and this technique has been applied in Go since
1.14 <span class="citation" data-cites="go1.14">[<a href="#ref-go1.14"
role="doc-biblioref">6</a>]</span>. This approach is limited due to the
fact that, some functions are not safe to get preempted by signals, such
as malloc(). <span class="citation"
data-cites="shiina2021lightweight">[<a href="#ref-shiina2021lightweight"
role="doc-biblioref">42</a>]</span> proposed another approach called
KLT-switching to overcome this issue.</p>
<p>Stackful coroutine assigns a separate stack to every coroutine. The
stack must be large enough for maximal possible usage, so it may be a
waste of memory. Go initially uses segmented stack to save stack memory.
New stack segments are automatically allocated as function invocations
need. They are linked for ease of management and traverse. Go switched
to continuous stack that can grow and shrink after V1.3. The growing is
realized with memory copy, thus incurs some overhead, and is
incompatible with C/C++, because it’s impossible to update references to
stack-allocated objects. Some C/C++ compilers, such as GCC <span
class="citation" data-cites="gcc">[<a href="#ref-gcc"
role="doc-biblioref">13</a>]</span> and Clang <span class="citation"
data-cites="clang">[<a href="#ref-clang"
role="doc-biblioref">4</a>]</span>, also support segmented stack, but
this feature have yet to become the mainstream. We want to solve this
problem with the help of modern hardware. As modern 64-bit address-space
is big enough for the allocation of many large continuous stacks, we can
make use of madvise() to request the OS kernel to release unused
physical memory pages in the stacks, so that they consume only address
space. When the space is accessed again in the future, OS kernel will
implicitly allocate new pages via page fault trap to meet the needs. We
believe this is a sweet point for the trade off between memory
consumption, execution efficiency and solution compatibility. And we
call for kernel support for more efficient reclamation of the pages.</p>
<p>Ref. <span class="citation" data-cites="dolan2013compiler">[<a
href="#ref-dolan2013compiler" role="doc-biblioref">26</a>]</span> shares
a common goal with CACS to minimize the number of spilled registers when
switching context. It proposed a new primitive in compiler backend
(LLVM) specifically for context switching called <code>SwapStack</code>.
It also managed to expose the primitive to users throughout the whole
compiling pipeline. On the other hand, CACS constitutes of a few
functions in templatized inline assembly code of tens of lines as (part
of) a library. And it’s only a matter of syntax adjustment for CACS to
support other compilers (e.g. clang, gcc, cl, etc.) and platforms (e.g.
Linux, Windows, macOS, etc.). In addition, we propose in-stack generator
for efficient asymmetric coroutine, which was not addressed in <span
class="citation" data-cites="dolan2013compiler">[<a
href="#ref-dolan2013compiler" role="doc-biblioref">26</a>]</span>. And
we also propose preserve_none calling convention for further
improvements of all switching functions. It is especially important to
simple functions, as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig:yield-preserve-none"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:yield-preserve-none">11</a>, the yield() function
would have been compiled to twice more instructions (24 vs 12), if not
with preserve_none.</p>
<p>This paper focuses on performance measurement and optimizations of
coroutine, specifically for stackful coroutine in compiled languages.
Our work should be applicable for JIT compilation of high-level
languages. And we believe it is also enlightening for dynamically typed
languages.</p>
<h2 id="stackless-coroutine-and-event-driven-paradigm">Stackless
Coroutine and Event-Driven Paradigm</h2>
<p>Stackless coroutine in compiled languages is translated into
event-driven code during compilation, and there exists some work <span

that does similar (source-to-source) translation before the advent of
stackless coroutine in these languages. They usually provide new
keyword(s) that act(s) like <code>co_await</code> in C++20 stackless
coroutine, such as <code>tamed</code> in <span class="citation"
data-cites="krohn2007events">[<a href="#ref-krohn2007events"
role="doc-biblioref">30</a>]</span> and <code>async</code> in <span
class="citation" data-cites="harris2011ac">[<a href="#ref-harris2011ac"
role="doc-biblioref">28</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>The translations are introduced for dealing with the so-called
“stacking-ripping” <span class="citation"
data-cites="adya2002cooperative">[<a href="#ref-adya2002cooperative"
role="doc-biblioref">20</a>]</span> problem that arises in asynchronous
even-driven code. They proposed to automatically rip the stacks with
(pre)compilers instead of doing it manually, as it is complex and
error-prone. Stackless coroutine can be regarded as the lastest
evolution of compiler translation in order to get rid of this
problem.</p>
<p>Stackful coroutines internally deals with events, too. Take
Photon <span class="citation" data-cites="photon">[<a href="#ref-photon"
role="doc-biblioref">9</a>]</span> for example, it has several event
engines to interoperate with asynchronous &amp; event-driven APIs
provided by host OS kernel, such as libaio or io_uring, etc. When an
event occurs, Photon switches to the handling coroutine by loading its
stack address and jumping to its execution address. This is very similar
to invoking a callback function in event-driven paradigm, in the
perspective of machines. The primary difference is that we load the
address of context into <span>rsp</span> (effectively <span>r7</span>)
instead of <span>rdi</span> (effectively <span>r5</span>; the 1st
argument by convention).</p>
<h2 id="others">Others</h2>
<p>It has been proved in <span class="citation"
data-cites="lauer1979duality">[<a href="#ref-lauer1979duality"
role="doc-biblioref">31</a>]</span> that events and threads are duals,

better one still seems endless. Today’s debate between stackless and
stackful coroutines is essentially a continuation of the former one. We
believe both events and threads have their best-fit scenarios. In
addition to the optimizations for stackful coroutine, Photon also
supports scheduling of stackless coroutine in conjunction with stackful
coroutine, and it provides an optimal memory pool for efficient
allocation of contexts in stackless coroutine.</p>
<p>Minimizing the number of registers to spill during context switching
is also a major goal in preemptive threading, such as <span
class="citation" data-cites="lin2016enabling">[<a
href="#ref-lin2016enabling" role="doc-biblioref">32</a>]</span>. It is
completely different compared to CACS, due to their preemptive
nature.</p>
<h1 id="limitations-and-future-work">Limitations and Future Work</h1>
<p>In this paper, we propose efficient techniques to make stackful
coroutine fast. Although we have demonstrated promising results, there
exists limitations that need further improvements.</p>
<p>We call for compiler / language support for in-stack generator. In
section <a href="#sec:in-stack-gen" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:in-stack-gen">3.2</a> we have proprosed in-stack
generator that makes efficient use of registers to pass information
forth-and-back. When it comes to generator recursion, we have to resort
to shared memory for passing information about the promise object
between the frames of recursion. The object actually has a small size of
16 bytes, and it’s better to share it in a pair of registers. If the
users create more than one concurrent generator, it’s better for the
compiler to detect it and create additional stack(s) as needed.
Compilers can further inline a whole generator if proper conditions are
met.</p>
<p>We call for compiler and runtime support for coroutine-local
variables, in correspondence to thread-local variables. And for an
optimization that automatically applies the proposed calling convention
to suitable functions.</p>
<p>We call for OS kernel support for more efficient page reclamation.
Stackful coroutine depends on madvise() to request the OS kernel to
reclaim unused physical memory pages in the stacks (but not releasing
the virtual addresses). This incurs an overhead to flush involved TLB
entries in all threads of current process. And the overhead increases
with the number of threads / CPU cores increasing. There is possibility
for more efficient flushing policy. For example, current thread can
flush TLB immediately in the madvise() syscall, whereas others try to
postpone the flushing until later they enter the kernel themselves.
There would be an inconsistent view of the process of freeing the unused
pages. This should be tolerable in many scenarios. And the reclamation
should take place in an order from the coldest pages to the hottest
pages.</p>
<p>We call for architectural support for explicit management of Return
Stack Buffer (RSB). Modern CPUs generally incorporate an implicit RSB to
predict target addresses of return instructions, as a special form of
branch predictor. RSB is supposed to be, after a context switching,
entirely invalid and inferior to the general predictor in this case.
That’s why classic context switching functions prefer the pop-and-jmp
instruction pair to the usual ret. If it’s possible to directly clear
RSB, or better switch RSB as part of the context, that would be very
helpful, not only for user-space context switching, but also for
kernel-space security. There have been reports of vulnerabilities
regarding RSB, and the kernel developers tried very hard to effectively
clear RSB <span class="citation" data-cites="fixing-rsb">[<a
href="#ref-fixing-rsb" role="doc-biblioref">25</a>]</span>, at the cost
of an “impressive” amount of memory.</p>
<p>This work is carried out on the x86-64 architecture with SysV (AMD64)
ABI, which is our primary environment. We expect higher speedups for
other ABI (e.g. Microsoft x64 ABI) or architecture (e.g. AArch64), as
they have more registers to spill during a classic context
switching.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>In this paper we carry out in-depth measurement on coroutine
implementations, finding out key issues regarding performance. And we
propose effective optimizations for stackful coroutine, making its weak
cases no longer weak, and strong cases even stronger. We also suggest
some future work for possible further improvement. We implement the
proposed optimizations in Photon and Clang, respectively. The source
code is open-sourced on GitHub for blinded review. We’ll try to merge
our work to corresponding upstreams after review.</p>
