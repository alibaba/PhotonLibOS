# Photon

[![CI](https://github.com/alibaba/PhotonLibOS/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/alibaba/PhotonLibOS/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Photon is a high-efficiency LibOS framework, based on a set of carefully selected C++ libs.

The role of LibOS is to connect user apps and the kernel. Following the principle of Least Astonishment,
we designed Photon's API to be as consistent as possible with glibc and POSIX semantics.
This flattens the learning curve for lib users and brings convenience when migrating legacy codebases.

Photon's runtime is driven by a coroutine lib. Out tests show that it has the **best** I/O performance in the
open source world by the year of 2022, even among different programing languages.

As to the project vision, we hope that Photon would help programs run as *fast* and *agile*
as the [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon) particle, which exactly is the naming came from.

## Features
* Coroutine library (support multi-thread)
* Async event engine, natively integrated into coroutine scheduling (support epoll or [io_uring](https://github.com/axboe/liburing))
* Multiple I/O engines: psync, posix_aio, libaio, io_uring
* Multiple socket implementations: tcp (level-trigger/edge-trigger), unix-domain, zero-copy, libcurl, TLS support, etc.
* A full functionality HTTP client/server (even faster than Nginx)
* A simple RPC client/server
* A POSIX-like filesystem abstraction and some implementations: local fs, http fs, fuse fs, etc.
* A bunch of useful tools: io-vector manipulation, resource pool, object cache, mem allocator, callback delegator,
  pre-compiled logging, ring buffer, etc.

While Photon has already encapsulated many mature OS functionalities, it remains keen to the latest kernel features,
and prepared to wrap them into the framework. It is a real killer in the low level programing field.

## Performance

### 1. IO

Compare Photon and fio when reading an 3.5TB NVMe raw device.

Note that fio only enables 1 job (process).

|        | IO Engine |  IO Type  | IO Size | IO Depth | DirectIO | QPS  | Throughput | CPU util |
|:------:|:---------:|:---------:|:-------:|:--------:|:--------:|:----:|:----------:|:--------:|
| Photon | io_uring  | Rand-read |   4KB   |   128    |   Yes    | 433K |   1.73GB   |   100%   |
| Photon |  libaio   | Rand-read |   4KB   |   128    |   Yes    | 346K |   1.38GB   |   100%   |
|  fio   |  libaio   | Rand-read |   4KB   |   128    |   Yes    | 279K |   1.11GB   |   100%   |

Conclusion: Photon is faster than fio under this circumstance.

Note:
- The Streaming client is to measure echo server performance when handling high throughput. We will set up 4 client processes,
and each of them will create only one connection. Send coroutine and recv coroutine are running loops separately.
- The Ping-pong client is to measure echo server performance when handling large amounts of connections.
We will set up 10 client processes, and each of them will create 100 connections. Within a single connection, 
recv has to be invoked after send.
- Server and client are all cloud VMs, 64Core 128GB, Intel Platinum CPU 2.70GHz. The network bandwidth (unilateral) is 32Gb.
- This test was only meant to compare per-core QPS, so we limited the thread number to 1, for instance, set GOMAXPROCS=1.

Conclusion: Photon socket has the best per-core QPS.

#### 2.2 HTTP

Compare Photon and Nginx when serving static files, using Apache Bench(ab) as client.

Note that Nginx only enables 1 worker (process).

|        | File Size | QPS  | CPU util |
|:------:|:---------:|:----:|:--------:|
| Photon |    4KB    | 114K |   100%   |
| Nginx  |    4KB    | 97K  |   100%   |

Conclusion: Photon is faster than Nginx under this circumstance.

## Example

See the [simple example](examples/simple/simple.cpp) about how to write a Photon program.

Note the examples are also built from testing. When running performance test, remember to remove CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug.

## About Photon

Photon was originally created from the storage team of Alibaba Cloud since 2017. It's a production ready library, and has
been deployed to hundreds of thousands of hosts as the infrastructure of cloud software. We would like to make a
commitment that Photon will be continuously updated, as long as those cloud software still evolve.

Some open source projects are using Photon as well, for instance:

- [containerd/overlaybd](https://github.com/containerd/overlaybd) The storage backend of accelerated container image, providing a layering block-level image format, designed for container, secure container and virtual machine.
- [data-accelerator/photon-libtcmu](https://github.com/data-accelerator/photon-libtcmu) A TCMU implementation, reworked from tcmu-runner, acting as a iSCSI target.

Any addition to this list is appreciated, if you have been using Photon, or just enlightened by its coroutine design.

## Future work

We are building an independent website for developers to view the documents. Please stay tuned.
